# Zero Dollar Bites MERN Stack Project with Firebase Authentication
[site](https://zero-dollar-bites.web.app/)

Welcome to Zero Dollar Bites, a powerful MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack project featuring robust Firebase Authentication. In this repository, we demonstrate the development of a full-stack web application with an emphasis on secure user authentication through Firebase. Firebase Authentication simplifies the process of adding safe and reliable user registration, login, and logout functionality to your web application.


* Project Highlights
User Authentication: Zero Dollar Bites leverages Firebase Authentication, allowing users to create accounts using their email and password or log in using their preferred social media accounts, including Google, Facebook, and more.

Protected Private Routes: Our project features protected routes, ensuring that only authenticated users gain access to specific areas of the application. Firebase Authentication plays a pivotal role in effortlessly implementing these secure, private routes.

CRUD Operations: We've implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, demonstrating how to work with data stored in MongoDB. Users can create, read, update, and delete data within the application, showcasing the data manipulation capabilities of MongoDB.

Security and Scalability: Firebase Authentication takes care of vital security aspects, including password hashing and security best practices. The serverless architecture of Firebase ensures scalability and high availability for your application.

* Technology Stack
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Express: A robust backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
React: A versatile front-end library for crafting engaging user interfaces.
Node.js: A versatile JavaScript runtime environment used on the server.
Firebase Authentication: Provides strong user authentication and security features.
Additional Dependencies: Various other libraries and packages to enhance the functionality and user experience.
